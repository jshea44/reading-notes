# Readings: React and Forms
This reading teaches more things about React. In this case forms and the ternary Operator.
## React Docs - Forms
  1. A controlled component is an input form element whose value is controlled by React.
  2. This depends on the situation. Maybe if the form is short, mabe updating the state as the type is fine. It helps the user experience. However, if the form is long, then updating as they type might not be good because the amount of rerenders could be resource intensive.
  3. Your can use the event object that's passed to the handler function.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
  1. The most obvious reason we would use a ternary operator, as it relates to React, is the ability for inline use - to use conditions to render in our code.
  2. `(x===y) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
