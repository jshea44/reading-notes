Foundational/beginning information for the inner workings of how the web works as well as foundational Javascript concepts and web design.

#Getting Started
1. HTTP links
   Data sails through vast pathways
   Knowledge dances free

2. Browser parses the HTML file first. Finds any `<link>` or `<script>` elements. Then parses the CSS and Javascript from those.

3. Google Images. Makes sure you choose the option Creative Commons licenses in the Tools section to avoid copyright.

4. String: `let name = "Joshua";`
   Number: `let age = 30;`

5. A variable is a box that a piece of data can be placed into to be used later. They are important because it allows many different things to happen in a webpage dynamically.

#Introduction to HTML
1. An attribute in an HTML element is something extra to that element. It could be a name, a link, or something else that influences the element.

2. `<h1>Title Of Page</h1>` - element
   `<h1>` - opening tag
   `Title Of Page` - content
   `</h1>` - closing tag

3. The `<article>` tag should make sense on its own. Such as a blog or a news story. The `<section>` tag is more about grouping smaller similar pieces such as headlines.

4. A "typical" website includes the following elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

5. The `<meta>` tag is used in the `<head>` element to have data that isn't visble on the webpage but contains information such as what characters will be displayed, or author name, or discription.

#Miscellaneous
##How to start to design a Website.

1. The first step in designing a website is to make a list of all the goals you want out of your website.
2. The most important thing is what you want to accomplish.

##Semantics.

1. This has to do with semantics. The `<h1>` element is used for the top level heading on a page while a `<span>` is not. Even you you could style either in the way you want.
2. Makes it easier to look at the code and see what it is/does.

##What is JavaScript?

1. The ability to store information such as variables as well as being able to interact with things on the webpage such as clicking a button.
2. Using a `<script>` element for either internal or external Javascript.
