## CSS Transforms

  2. A way transform could be used in a website is that there could be a button that when hovered over, it gets larger indicating that it can be pressed. Or if you wanted you could have something spin when you hover the mouse over.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

  2. A CSS transition if limited to a single state alteration, whereas animations allow for more control.
