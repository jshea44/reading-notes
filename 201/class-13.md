# Readings
This reading was focusing on local storage and how it can by utilized to keep a save state of the user data/settings without having to make an account and grab that data from a server.
## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites
  1. A developer would use local storage for a web application to save the state of their application instead of it reseting everything every time an HTTP request is made or making a user make an account and utilizing a server.
  2. Personal information should not be stored because there is a way for that information to be seen by nefarious individuals.
  3. Local storage can only store strings. You could convert it to this type by using `JSON.stringify()` or `JSON.parse()`.
