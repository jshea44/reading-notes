## Readings
## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
  1. The three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are members listen to eachother, show sensitivity to feelings and needs, and conversational turn-taking and empathy.
  2. In my previous career, I was in the military working as a Security Forces Member. This was not an enjoyable job. In fact, it was stressful, unfulfilling, and draining. However, you work with the same team everyday, albeit you might be at differnt posts, and during that time of going to work people always gathered around before the shift started and chatted about life and about what to do later or even on the weekend. Because even though we were at work, we still felt like a family, and regardless of the state of the job, the relationship we all shared kept all of our psychological states safe.
  3. The impact of teams with a high degree of psychological safety are more efficient working together in teams and also tend to get along better. Ideas flow more freely between members. This in turn increases moral at a work place and makes it so more people would want to work at that business. All around that psychological safety creates bonds between members that allows everyone in that work place to gel together.
