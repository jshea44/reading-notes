# Readings: CSS Layout
This section helps to teach more about CSS and how it can be applied to projects. It's useful to understand when you want content on your webpage to be manipulated in a certain way depending on the window size.
## Learn CSS - Flexbox
  1. One dimensional content means that it takes a bunch or content, or a group of content, and manipulates them all together, creating the best layout for them.
  2. Main axis is determined by your `flex-direction`. If it's set to `row`, then your main axis is along the row. If it's column, then your main axis is along the column. Flex items move as a group along the main axis. On the cross-axis, you can move things individually or as a group.
  3. Accessibility can be affected because the visual order changes, not the logical order. Screen readers follow the logical order, not the new visual order, therefore keyboard navigation becomes disconnected.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox
  1. Flexbox can allow you to easily make "all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height" or "Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent."
  2. This topic connects to my long term goals in the sense that it can help create professional layouts for web pages that I will be creating as future projects. Those, in turn, will be added to my project portfolio helping to secure a job. Then maybe when I have a job, these topics will continue to support me in the work space.
