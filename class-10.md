# Readings: Debugging
This reading helps us to understand error messages and what should be done for the more common problems you will run into throughout your career.
## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript. 
  1. Syntax errors are spelling errors and accompanied by an error message. They will also stop your code from running. Logic errors do not stop the code from running. They do, however, give results in the program that were unexpected. 
  2. I've ran across a TypeError where I had something misspelled and had to fix the spelling. I've ran into plenty of logic errors. One that happened recently was with the cookie stand lab where we had to get the grand total. I had everything running, and a number was being produced, but the number was far too large to be correct. I realized I was adding to the grand total too many times in a nested for loop. I moved the line of code that added to the grand total out of the for loop and got the correct answer after that. I've also gotten SyntaxError which was usually just a missing semi colon that needed to be added.
  3. This topic will continue to influence my long term goals in the sense that there will always be bugs in your program. Understanding what these errors are can help you debug the problem sooner rather than later. 

## The JavaScript Debugger.
How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  1. Let's say you just wrote some code and you want to see.....
  2. The breakpoint is the place in your code you want to stop the execution.
  3. The call stack is the code that was run to get to the current line.
