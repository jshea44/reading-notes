# Readings: APIs
This reading is about REST and how it relates to back-end.
## API Design Best Practices
>  1. REST - Representational State Transfer
>  2. Resource. Which is any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
>  3. Identifier - A URI that uniquely identifies that resource. A URI for a customer: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
>  4. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
>  5. URIs should be based on nouns (the resource)
>  6. Good URI: https://adventure-works.com/orders (orders - a noun, as opposed to a verb)
>  7. A chatty web API is when it makes many requests for small amounts of data which imposes a load on the server. This is a bad thing.
>  8. 200 (OK)
>  9. 404 (Not Found)
>  10. 201 (Created)
>  11. 204 (No Content)
