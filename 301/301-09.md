# Readings: Functional Programming
This reading is to introduce the concepts of functional programming.
## Functional Programming Concepts
>  1. "Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs hat treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"
>  2. A pure function is something that will always return the same result given the same arguments. As for how we know if a function is pure or not: It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic) and it does not cause any observable side effects.
>  3. It's easier to test without having to mock anything.
>  4. Immutability means that something can't be changed. After something is created, it's state can not change. A new object must be created with new value stored.
>  5. "If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent." Essentially: pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency.



## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
>  1. A module is a new node file. Used for dividing up functionality for it to be easier to work on later and can just be called upon.
>  2. Allows us to make a reference to another module from the current module.
>  3. We have to use module.exports to export the thing that we want the other module to use as it's using require().
>  4. We have to set that require() that now has the function object passed to it from the other module into a variable on the current module. Then we can call that variable to run the function.
