# Readings: State and Props
This reading will help us understand the differences between state and props and when to use either one in our application.
## React lifecycle
  1. Based off the diagram, 'render' happens first.
  2. The first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is in the mounting phase, the constructor occurs.
  3. Correct order: `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`, `React Updates`, `componentWillUnmount`.
  4. This says that the component mounted and that any subscriptions can now be ran. You can now make an API call to YouTube for instance after this.

## React State Vs Props
  1. The things you can pass into the props are like arguments to a function. They are what you want to intialize your component to.
  2. The big difference between props and state is that props are something you pass into a component and must be updated outside the component and state is handled in that component and can be updated in the component.
  3. We re-render our application when state is used. This is to update what the user passes in inside the component.
  4. An example of something we can store in state is a counter, or something that gets updated.
