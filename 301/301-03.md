# Readings: Passing Functions as Props
This reading continues to expand upon the utilities of React including lists, spread operator, and how child components can invoke parent methods.
## React Docs - lists and keys
  1. `.map()` returns a new array
  2. You use curly braces to surround the value that you are displaying.
  3. Each list item needs a unique key.
  4. The purpose of a key is to "help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed."

## The Spread Operator
  1. The spread operator is a "useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments."
  2. - Adding to state in React
     - Combining objects
     - Concatenating or combining arrays
     - sing an array as arguments
  3. const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
     const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
     const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
     console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  4. const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
     const newItem = 4;
     const newArray = [...originalArray, newItem];
     console.log(newArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

  5. const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
     const combinedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
     console.log(combinedObj); // Output: { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }


## How to Pass Functions Between Components
  1. Creates the function in the same area the state that is being changed is.
  2. The increment function loops through the array of objects, increments the count value by 1, pushes that new value into the new array created by .map(), then replaces the old array with the new array.
  3. You pass a method from parent to child as you would any prop.
  4. The child invokes the method by calling it like a normal function.
