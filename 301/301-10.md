# Readings: In memory storage
This reading is about understanding how functions are called and in what order they are called. Also a bit of error messages.
## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
>  1. A call is a function invocation.
>  2. Only one call can happen at once.
>  3. LIFO means last in, first out. It's a principle of storing and managing function calls in a call stack.
>  4. Calling in this order: func1, func2, func3. Stack: func3, func2, func1. First one to leave the stack is func3 since it went in last.
>  6. "A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function without an exit point."

## JavaScript error messages
>  1. Trying to use a variable that is not yet declared.
>  2. Something that can not be parsed in terms of syntax. Can also be trailing commas.
>  3. Trying to manipulate an object and giving it an invalid range.
>  4. Trying to do something that is for a certain type on a type that doesn't support it. 
>  5. Stops your code at the point you put your debugger.
>  6. The debugger allows you to set a breakpoint up to that point that it was placed. It allows you to see the steps the program takes to get to that point.
