# Readings: Functional Programming
This reading is to introduce the concepts of functional programming
## Functional Programming Concepts
>  1. "Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs hat treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"
>  2. f
>  3. It's easier to test without having to mock anything.
>  4. Immutability means that something can't be changed. After something is created, it's state can not change. A new object must be created with new value stored.
>  5. "If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent." Essentially: pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency.
