# Readings: REST
This reading is about REST and HTTP as well as psychological safety.
## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
>  1. I worked in a team with other people as we painted houses. We always chatted on the way to a job site and sometimes stopped to get som ecoffee on the way. We'd always joke about things and try to make the job fun, even when it wasn't. It made doing the job much more enjoyable and allowed us to work together more efficiently.
>  2. Try to get to know people. Before you start brainstorming or doing whatever job you need to do, take a minute and just talk to each other. Allow everyone to loosen up around eachother. This could help myself and future colleagues work together more efficiently and perhaps open our minds for more creative thinking. 

## How I explained REST to my brother
>  1. Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet.
>  2. This is because the way we write code and develop is for humans when they look at a webpage, not so much for a computer to read/gather that information.
>  3. The HTTP protocol is the foundation of the web. Like GPS coordinates for anywhere in the world. Applies verbs to nouns (GET URL).
>  4. `GET` is what HTTP does to gather the necessary resources to display on a webpage.
>  5. `POST` is adding something.
>  6. `PUT` is replacing something.
>  7. `PATCH` is doing a partial update
