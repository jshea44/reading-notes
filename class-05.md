# Readings: Images, Color, Text
## HTML Media
  1. A real world case of using the `alt` attribute is when your image doesn't load. Instead it displays the text used to describe it which is the `alt`.
  2. You can improve accessibility by using the `alt` attribute and making it descriptive but not too long. This is because visually impaired people might be using screen readers.
  3. An example of when the  `figure` element would be useful is when you want to semantically link an image to its caption. You place the `img` element inside of a container called `figure` and then you can place a `figcaption` elemtnt in there as well. This creates a link between the image and the caption which is also better for screen readers.
  4. 1. `gif` - 
     2. `svg` - 
  5. The image type you would use to for a screenshot would be either PNG or lossless webP. This keeps the image from getting blurry wich is especially important if you have text in the image that needds to be readable.
