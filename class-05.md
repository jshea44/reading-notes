# Readings: Images, Color, Text
Understanding how CSS interacts with HTML is important when it comes to designing a webpage. Also understanding the aspects of images with `alt` text helps in regards to accessibility when it comes to screen readers.
## HTML Media
  1. A real world case of using the `alt` attribute is when your image doesn't load. Instead it displays the text used to describe it which is the `alt`.
  2. You can improve accessibility by using the `alt` attribute and making it descriptive but not too long. This is because visually impaired people might be using screen readers.
  3. An example of when the  `figure` element would be useful is when you want to semantically link an image to its caption. You place the `img` element inside of a container called `figure` and then you can place a `figcaption` element in there as well. This creates a link between the image and the caption which is also better for screen readers.
  4. 1. The difference between `gif` and `svg` is "A GIF file is a type of image that can move, like a short video, while an SVG file is an image that can be made bigger or smaller without getting blurry.(ChatGPT)"
  5. The image type you would use to for a screenshot would be either PNG or lossless webP. This keeps the image from getting blurry wich is especially important if you have text in the image that needds to be readable.

## Learn CSS
  1. When you look at a website, the text and content you see is the foreground color. The space behind the text or behind the entire page is backgroud color.
  2. I would add a background color, or maybe backgroud colors to different sections or divs depending on the layout. Probably change the text colors as well depending on the background color.
  3. When it comes to choosing fonts you should consider whether they are web safe or not. This is because not all browswers support all fonts. 
  4. 1. `font-size` - changes the size of the font
     2. `font-weight` - changes the thickness of the text (bold or thinner)
     3. `font-style` - used to turn the text italic or not
