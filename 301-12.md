# Readings: CRUD
This reading is mostly about status codes and a bit about building a REST API.
## Status Codes Based On REST Methods
>  1.  1. Informational status codes.
>      2. Success codes.
>      3. Redirection codes.
>      4. Client error codes.
>      5. Server error codes.
>    
>  2.  'Accepted' - tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.
>  3.  'Permanent Redirect' - tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.
>  4.  204 No Content
>  5.  410 Gone
>  6.  403 Forbidden - 'The client has authorized or doesnâ€™t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.'

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick 
>  1. For when we deploy the server and don't want to use local host.
>  2. Code that runs when the server gets a request, but before it gets passed to your routes.
>  3. Allows our server to accept JSON as a body instead of a post element or get element.
>  4. This is a param.
>  5. PUT would update everything, PATCH only updates a portion.
>  6. You add default as a key. So if you want a default date you could say default: Date.now
>  7. It means there's an error on your server, nothing to do with the user or client.
>  8. 201 - successfully created something. 200 - just a general success (less specific)
