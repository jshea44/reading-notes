This reading..
## What is OAuth
>  1. "OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential."
>  2. "When you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon."
>  3. The first website connects to the second, The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret, The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software, The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website, the user approves a particular transaction type at the first website, The user is given an approved access token, The user gives the approved access token to the first website, The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication, The second website lets the first website access their site, The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
>  4. Open AI is for humans logging into machines. It's for authentication.
