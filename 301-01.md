# Readings: Introduction to React and Components 

## Component-Based Architecture
  1. "A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation."
  2. The characteristics of a component are: reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.
  3. The advantages of using component-based architecture are: ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React
  1. 'Props' is short for properties.
  2. "Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data), then pass it to child component(s) by using Props, finally, render the Props Data."
  3. The flow of Props is unidirectional (one way from parent to child).
