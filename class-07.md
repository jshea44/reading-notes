 # Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
This reading teaches the importance of domain models and how they help organize our problems using objects. It also helps to understand how useful constructors can be as well as prototypes.
## Domain Modeling
  1. Domain modeling helps us to understand the problems that we are introduced with. In programming, we use objects to represent the entities that represent the domain including its attributes, behaviours, and constraints.

## HTML Table Basics
  1. Tables should not be used in page layout because they reduce accessibility for visually impaired individuals when screen readers are being used, they produce too many tags that makes it hard to find things in your code to update or maintain, and they are not automatically responsive meaning they don't size to the screen, they size to their content.
  3.  1. `<td>` - table data. This is used to hold the data inside a cell.
      2. `<tr>` - table row. This places the table cells into a row so that the tables cells don't continue to an endless row.
      3. `<th>` - table header. These are cells that go at the beginning of a row or column that give a a name to the type of data in the cells under/next to them. Helps to see what the data is.

## Introducing Constructors
  1. A constructor is a function with the keyword `new`. This is used to instantiate a new object taken from a constructor function. 
  2. The keyword `this` differs in the sense that in an object literal, it's used to refer to that object that was created. In a constructor, `this` is used to refer to the object that is created using the constructor. So basically all objects sharing the same methods/attributes. 

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
  1. 1. Inheritance - A staff sergeant and a senior airman do all the same things/jobs in the Air Force, however, a staff sergeant has additional duties that the senior airman does't have including writing EPR's.
     2. prototype -
