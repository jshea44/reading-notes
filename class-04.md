# Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
## Creating Hyperlinks
  1. To add a link we wrap text and other content aroung a `<a>` tag.
  2. The `href` attribute contains the website address.
  3. Some of the ways links can be more accessible is to make the link descriptive in the text instead of saying 'click here.' Also use keywords so that search engines can fine them easier.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning 
  1. Normal flow is how a web displays the page without any manipulation in the use of CSS.
  2. Block-level stretches the entire block it's in. You can't place things next to them. Inline on the other hand is only as big as the content. Such as a line of text. Inline allows other inline content to be placed next to it on the same line.
  3. Satic positioning is the default for every html element.
  4. A few advantages of using absolute positioning could be UI features that you can move on your own, popup boxes, or control menus.
  5. The key difference absolute positioning and fixed positioning is absolute positioning is relative to its nearest ancestor while fixed positioning relative to the viewport.

## Functions â€“ Reusable Blocks of Code
  1. The difference between a function declaration and a function invocation is that function declaration is the act of defining a function such as `function funcName() {//what this function does}`. Function invocation on the other hand allows you to use that function that you made. Also known as calling the function: `funcName();`.
  2. Parameter and argument are sometimes used interchangably to reference the same thing. But to be more specific lets take an example of a function: `function displayName(name) {console.log(name);}` In this declaration we can see that there are parenthesis next to the function name. In this declaration, the keyword 'name' is a parameter in the declaration. When you invoke a function: `displayName("Joshua");`, "Joshua" is the argument being passed into the function. Sometimes you might see something like: `function myFunction(...args) {}`, which just means that this function's parameters has multiple arguments that can be passed.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
  1. 1. Learning from fellow students - During this processes it could become obvious in the way that someone else thinks when they are either typing the code or when they are explaining it. Seeing how someone else thinks through a problem could help you see that there are multiple ways of thinking through it and you might start to naturally expand the way you think of problems.
     2. Engaged collaboration - When you are alone you might start to space off or procrastinate and it might not feel as fun. When you are collaborating with someone though, it might start to become more enoyable and you and the other person may be more engaged.
