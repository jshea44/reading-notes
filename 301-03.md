# Readings: Passing Functions as Props

## React Docs - lists and keys
  1. `.map()` returns a new array
  2. You use curly braces to surround the value that you are displaying.
  3. Each list item needs a unique key.
  4. The purpose of a key is to "help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed."

## The Spread Operator
  1. The spread operator is a "useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments."
  2. - Adding to state in React
     - Combining objects
     - Concatenating or combining arrays
     - sing an array as arguments
  3. `const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
     const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

     const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

     console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
