# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics
  1. An object is a collection of things that are related. These are things that describe what that object is or what it can do. For instance, in this collection, you could have data describing what the object looks like, maybe long hair, brown hair, four legs, two eyes, etc. You could also have data that describes what this object can do such as bark, pant, run, eat, rollover.
