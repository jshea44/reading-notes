# Readings: MongoDB and Mongoose
This reading is about databases in regards to SQL and noSQL.
## nosql vs sql
>  1. |                               SQL                                       |                                       noSQL                                                |

>     | SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases              | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database              |
>     | SQL databases have predefined schema                                    | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data                                  |
>     | SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties                             | NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem                                             |
>     | Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors | NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support                                 |
>     | SQL databases are table based databases                                 | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
>  2. A good data type for SQL is table based.
>  3. A real world example could be anything with integers. 
>  4. A good data type for noSQL is document based.
>  5. A real world example could be user data or profiles with user history.
>  6. noSQL is best for hierarchical data storage
>  7. Both can scale, but SQL would probably be easier with verticle scalability.
