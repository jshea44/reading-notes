# Readings: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
## Continue Reading Introduction to HTML
  1. Semantic elements are used for different reasons. Having the correct type of elements allows scrapers to find what they are looking for in your website. Having semantic elements is also important because of the default way browsers display elements. For instance, `<h1>` is going to have a default font size larger than `<h2>`.
  2. There are 6 levels of headings in HTML. `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
  3. Some of the uses for `<sup>` are maybe for dates or indicating a square root in a math. `<sub>` could be used for indicating chemical compounds.
  4. The "title" attribute.

## Learn CSS
  1. The three ways of applying CSS to our HTML are inline styles, external stylesheet, and internal stylesheet.
  2. Inline styles are inefficient. You are placing CSS directly into an HTML elements which could make it more difficult to make changes later on if need be.
  3. 1. The h2 is the selector.
     2. The declarations are what is inbetween the curly braces also known as the declaration block.
     3. Color and padding are the properties.

## Learn JS
  1. This is called a String.
  2. Four Javascript operators are addition: `+`, assignment: `=`, strict equality: `===`, and Does-not-equal: `!==`.
  3. Trying to calulate on a calulator. A function that takes the two numbers that the user inputs and equating based on the operator used.

  1. An if statement checks a CONDITION and if it evaluates to TRUE, then the code block will execute.
  2. The use of an `else if` allows for more selection. For instance, having a program that gives a letter grade to a student based on their percentage. You don't want them to only have an A or an F. Having `else if` allows there to be B, C, and D.
  3. Three comparison operators are Greater than: `>`, Less than or equal to: `<=`, and Strict-non-equality: `!==`.
  4. The logical operator `&&` is AND, which means all conditionals must be true to evaluate to true. The logical operator `||` is OR, which means only one conditional needs to be true to evaluate to true.
