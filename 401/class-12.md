## Web Sockets

> 1. A websocket is a communication protocol that allows real time data exchange between clients.
> 2. The client sends a requres, the the server responds with an acceptance. Once connected, real-time communication occurs, or bidirectional data transfer.
> 3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a REQUEST from that client.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

> 1. "WebSocket is a protocol for real-time, full-duplex communication. Socket.IO is a library built on top of WebSocket that provides additional features like fallbacks, room management, and reconnection handling, simplifying real-time web applications development."
> 2. "Use Socket.IO for real-time web applications where you need bidirectional communication, event-driven updates, and support for various transports and fallbacks."
> 3. "Use WebSockets for low-latency, full-duplex communication between a client and server in applications requiring real-time data exchange, such as chat or gaming."
