## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

> useReducer makes a change in state by taking in a callback function that allows the state to change based on what callback that was placed in. Sort of like a subscriber, it changes based on something else happening. This allows there to be a clear and concise way of managing state.

> useContext allows values to be accessed without the need to pass props in. This makes it very easy to share data between components especially in a larger application. The useContext and useReducer can be used together for a global state management system. useReduce can be placed in Context and this would allow mulitple components to access that state.

> Basically, they work "together to streamline state management by centralizing state logic and providing a clean way to share and access state across different parts of your application." This is, again, extremely useful for large applications and gives more modularity.
