# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

This reading focuses on Node, npm, and tests.

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

> 1. "Middleware is software that connects and helps different applications or systems communicate and work together, like a bridge between them, enabling data exchange and seamless operations."
> 2. Express is the most popular NODE WEB FRAMEWORK.
> 3. This means that Express has few restictions when it comes to combining components to achieve a goal. It is more flexible in solving a problem.
> 4. A module is a file or library that can be used in other code. Modularity is important because it allows developers to more easily troubleshoot problems. It also allows different peices of code to be used elsewhere without having to rewrite it all.

## What is NPM?

> 1. npm version: 9.8.1
> 2. npm install jshint

## What is TDD?

> 1. "Tests are important because they ensure that the software works correctly, like checking if a car's brakes function. They catch and prevent errors, making the program reliable and safe."
> 2. Three expected benefits: reductions in defect rates, reduction in effort in projects’ final phases, leads to improved design qualities in the code.
> 3. Two individual pitfalls and two team pitfalls: forgetting to run tests frequently, writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained, poor maintenance of the test suite, partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD.

## CI/CD

> 1. Three benefits: "Early Detection of Issues", "Faster Development Cycles", "Improved Collaboration"
> 2. "Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures that code is always in a deployable state, but deployment to production is a manual decision. Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release process, automatically deploying code changes to production without manual intervention when tests pass."
> 3. "GitHub acts as a safe and organized place to store and share code. It plays a crucial role in Continuous Integration (CI) by automatically checking if the code works when changes are made. For Continuous Delivery (CD), GitHub helps manage and track these code changes, making it easier to prepare and decide when to release new software updates."
