# React Native

## getting started with react native

> 1. View - sort of like a div, container for other components, Text - sort of like a p, used to display text, Image - used for displaying images.
> 2. React solves the problem of cross-platform development. "Native" is used because it uses the native UI elements from the given platform.
> 3. The building blocks are components and APIs. It's the same for React and react native, except react native uses platform-specific UI elements, React uses the DOM.

## expo

> 1. "Expo simplifies React Native development with pre-built components, a development environment, and easy deployment, streamlining the app-building process."
> 2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the "developer-friendly" workflow.
> 3. "React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile apps, while Expo is a set of tools and services that simplifies the React Native development process."

## expo snack

> 1. "Snack allows you to develop and run React Native projects directly in your browser." It allows you to see live updates of your app.

## ejecting

> 1. It means that you are taking your expo-managed project and moving it over to React Native.
> 2. A few reasons why you shouldn't eject: if your project is simple and doesn't require extensive customization, when speed matters, and for ease of development.
> 3. Why you would eject would be if the scope of your project exceeds what expo can offer. When you may need access to native modules.
