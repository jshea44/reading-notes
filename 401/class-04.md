# Readings: Data Modeling

This reading is about comparing SQL and NoSQL.

## nosql vs sql

> 1. SQL database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment.
> 2. NoSQL database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage.
> 3. "SQL databases can handle more load by upgrading a single server's hardware, while NoSQL databases handle large traffic by adding more servers, like building more lanes on a highway."

## sql modeling techniques

> 1. A one to many relationship means that a record in a table, there can be many related records in another. We connect them using keys.
> 2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to CREATE a VISUAL DIAGRAM of the database tables and their relationships.
> 3. A primary key identifies records in a table, while a foreign key links one table to another by referencing the primary key.

## sql vs nosql (video)

> 1. Keywords in SQL are written in uppercase and not enclosed in quotes. Parameters are values supplied to queries that can be dynamically changed.
> 2. "Normalization in databases is a method of structuring data to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency by breaking it into smaller, related tables. It ensures data integrity and minimizes anomalies."
> 3. "One-to-one means each item has a unique match; one-to-many implies one item connects to several; and many-to-many indicates multiple items link to multiple others. These analogies relate to how candidates match jobs: 1 candidate-1 job, 1 candidate-multiple jobs, or multiple candidates-multiple jobs."
