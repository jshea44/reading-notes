## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

> 1. It restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. So some roles may be able to view content but not create, while others can delete and so forth.
> 2. "You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employeesâ€™ positions in the organization."
> 3. Reducing administrative work and IT support, Maximizing operational efficiency, Improving compliance.

## Compare: react-cookie library && react-cookies component

> 1. Universal Cookies, React Hooks, Cookie Management Functions, Higher-Order Component
> 2. Cookies Management, Univeral Support, API
> 3. I would prefer react-cookies mostly because of the ability to use React hooks.
