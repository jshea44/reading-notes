# Readings: Authentication

This reading is about authentication and how it is used.

## Securing passwords

> 1. "To protect a password, we use a secure algorithm (like bcrypt), which turns it into a jumbled code (hash) before storing it."
> 2. "Bcrypt is a cryptographic hashing algorithm used for securely storing passwords."
> 3. "Bcrypt enhances password security by creating irreversible hashes, thwarting password theft even if the database is compromised."

## Basic Auth

> 1. "It's a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a username and password when making a request."
> 2. Authorization, Basic, and credentials
> 3. You combine the username and password into a string, then convert that string into a different string using Base64 encoding.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

> 1. "Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity in web applications. It often involves usernames and passwords, but can also include multi-factor methods like security questions or fingerprint recognition."
> 2. "Error messages in authentication should be generic and not reveal specific details like incorrect username or password. This prevents attackers from exploiting such information and enhances security."
