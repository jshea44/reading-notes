## useEffect hook

> 1. The main intended use case of useEffect is to connect components to external systems and to allow an effect to activate as a side effect to what it is 'subscribed' to.
> 2. The effect's logic interacts with the component in three stages: when the component mounts, when the component rerenders, and when the component unmounts. Assuming the useEffect is 'subscribed' to said component.
> 3. The importance of the return value from the effectâ€™s logic function is "a cleanup function, important for cleaning up resources or state when the component unmounts or when dependencies change."
