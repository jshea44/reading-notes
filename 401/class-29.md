# Advanced State with Reducers

## Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

> 1. A motivation for adding a reducer is when your project gets too large and it becomes more difficult to track all the different ways your state is changing. It can get overwhelming when you have many state updates spread across many event handlers.
> 2. "Actions are objects that describe user interactions and are used to update state via a reducer. They provide a more descriptive approach than direct state setting."
> 3. "useReducer is named for the list operation "reduce" because it consolidates state updates into a reducer function, reducing complexity and improving manageability."
> 4. "Switch to useReducer when managing complex state updates, debugging, or testing, or when structure and separation of concerns are needed."
