# Readings: Express REST API

This reading is a reviews on classes as well as diving deeper into Express.

## Review: ES6 Classes

> 1. Classes are templates for creating OBJECTS.
> 2. No, class declarations can not be hoisted.
> 3. "A JavaScript constructor is like a cookie cutter for creating objects with specific properties. "this" refers to the current object being worked on within a function, helping to access and manipulate its properties."

## Using Express Routing

> 1. "Routing in Express refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs or URLs) respond to client requests."
> 2. A route path is specified by the URL endpoint, while a route method handles HTTP methods such as GET or POST.
> 3. Use 'next' in a parameter when you use a middleware. If it is used in the parameter, call 'next()' to pass control to the next middleware.

## Express Routing

> 1. Express Router is a lightweight routing system in Express.js that can be used in seperate modules for increase organization and flexibility.
> 2. First, you create an instance of the router in an Express server. Then define routes, middleware, and handlers on this router before applying it to the main application.
> 3. Middleware allows us to perform additional actions before processing a request.
